		<h2>Abstract</h2>
		<p>
			In our final project, we focused on 2D NPR, non-photorealistic rendering. 
            We wanted to work with NPR to explore the artistic side of graphics and render images in abstract ways that are still recognizable. 
            We implemented posterization, pencil sketch, and watercolor effects on images. 
            We started our project from scratch and used Pillow, Python’s photo imaging library. 
            We used OpenCV as inspiration for methods and features we could implement ourselves and enjoyed learning about different blurring and filtering techniques.

		<h2>Technical approach</h2>
        <h3>Posterization</h3>
        <p>
            To implement posterization, we needed to develop a scheme to select an appropriate color palette given the RGB values of each pixel on the image. 
            We experimented with different schemes, such as having a pre-set color palette, averaging RGB values, or creating color ‘bins’. 
            Some problems we encountered included issues with images containing fewer prominent colors, which would output an image with very few colors. 
            We solved this by reworking our algorithm to choose more colors. 
            To find a representative color palette, we ended up iterating through each color and adding it to our palette as long as it is differentiable from the rest of the color palette. 
            We define being ‘differentiable’ based on the euclidean distance of a color’s RGB values. 
            Then, we map each pixel’s color to a color in our reduced palette based on euclidean distance. 
            We learned that there are many different ways to get similar outputs, so we spent time experimenting to see what output we liked the best. 
        </p>

        <h3>Pencil sketch</h3>
        <p>
            In our pencil sketch algorithm, we first convert the image to grayscale. 
            Then we invert the image to find and emphasize the edges. 
            Then, we apply a gaussian blur in order to smooth out and reduce the complexity of the image. 
            Lastly, we invert it back and obtain the final effect by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurred image. 
            We were surprised by how seemingly simple this effect was using library functions. 
            To make the effect unique, we decided to implement our own function for the gaussian blur, which a bulk of our efforts for developing this effect went into. 
            We used the following gaussian function to calculate a weight matrix, which is used to calculate the value of the gaussian blur. 
            We ran into issues where the output was unexpectedly noisy but fixed this by debugging our blur function and the way we divided the images at the end.
