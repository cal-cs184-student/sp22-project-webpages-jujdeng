		<h2>Summary</h2>
		<p>
			So far we've accomplished taking in an image and outputting a posterized version of it. 
            Using Python's Pillow library, we experimented with different kinds of image processing.
            We take in an image, get the RGB values of each pixel, and find the most similar color based on the RGB color value distances.
            Our process so far is finding the six most common colors by repeatedly averaging all the pixels and removing the colors that are within a distance to this average color. This effectively leaves our image with just 6 colors.
        </p>
        <p>
			We also tried keeping colors based on closest brightness values, but sometimes the main part of the image and the background brightnesses were too similar.
        </p>
        <p>
			Another issue we ran into was when an image already had similar colors, the output looked like just 2 colors instead of 6 because the pixel values were mostly all closest to those 2 specific colors.
        </p>
        <p>
			We addressed these issues with clamping and using RGB distance values rather than brightness. 
            For clamping, we wanted the color values to round down to a multiple of a certain number. 
            Thus, similar colors would get clamped down to have the same value. 
            We counted how many pixels each clamped value had and got the top few to get the bounds of our colors. 
            Then, based on the bounds, we assigned pixels of similar colors within certain bounds to have a certain color. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Our results so far are good! We are able to output images with a cool artistic effect with simplified color palettes.
        </p>

		<h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            When we planned this project, we were unsure of whether we'd take in inputs of 3D .dae files or 2D .jpg/.png images.
            In our work so far, we've only looked at 2D images and have made significant progress on our posterization effect.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our progress is according to plan, but we do want to try extending our work to 3D. We're not quite sure what this will look like.
        </p>
